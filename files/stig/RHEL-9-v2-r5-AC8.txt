Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting local or remote access to the system via a command line user logon.
Discussion:
Display of a standardized and approved use notification before granting access to the operating system ensures privacy and security notification verbiage used is consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

System use notifications are required only for access via login interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

Check Text:
Verify RHEL 9 displays the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the operating system via a command line user logon.

Check that a banner is displayed at the command line login screen with the following command:

$ sudo cat /etc/issue

If the banner is set correctly it will return the following text:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

By using this IS (which includes any device attached to this IS), you consent to the following conditions:

-The USG routinely intercepts and monitors communications on this IS for purposes including, but not limited to, penetration testing, COMSEC monitoring, network operations and defense, personnel misconduct (PM), law enforcement (LE), and counterintelligence (CI) investigations.

-At any time, the USG may inspect and seize data stored on this IS.

-Communications using, or data stored on, this IS are not private, are subject to routine monitoring, interception, and search, and may be disclosed or used for any USG-authorized purpose.

-This IS includes security measures (e.g., authentication and access controls) to protect USG interests--not for your personal benefit or privacy.

-Notwithstanding the above, using this IS does not constitute consent to PM, LE or CI investigative searching or monitoring of the content of privileged communications, or work product, related to personal representation or services by attorneys, psychotherapists, or clergy, and their assistants. Such communications and work product are private and confidential. See User Agreement for details."

If the banner text does not match the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner exactly, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 to display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system via command line logon.

Edit the "/etc/issue" file to replace the default text with the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner. The DOD-required text is:

"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System (IS) that is provided for USG-authorized use only.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting local or remote access to the system via a SSH logon.
Discussion:
The warning message reinforces policy awareness during the logon process and facilitates possible legal action against attackers. Alternatively, systems whose ownership should not be obvious should ensure usage of a banner that does not provide easy attribution.

Check Text:
Verify any SSH connection to RHEL 9 displays the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system.

Check for the location of the banner file being used with the following command:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*banner'
/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/80-bannerPointer.conf:Banner /etc/issue

This command will return the banner keyword and the name of the file that contains the SSH banner (in this case "/etc/issue").

If the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 to display the Standard Mandatory DOD Notice and Consent Banner before granting access to the system via ssh.

Edit the "etc/ssh/sshd_config" file or a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d" to uncomment the banner keyword and configure it to point to a file that will contain the logon banner (this file may be named differently or be in a different location if using a version of SSH that is provided by a third-party vendor).

An example configuration line is:
