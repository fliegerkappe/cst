Rule Title:
RHEL 9 libreswan package must be installed.
Discussion:
Providing the ability for remote users or systems to initiate a secure VPN connection protects information when it is transmitted over a wide area network.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000120-GPOS-00061
Check Text:
Note: If there is no operational need for Libreswan to be installed, this rule is not applicable.

Verify that RHEL 9 libreswan service package is installed.

Check that the libreswan service package is installed with the following command:

$ dnf list --installed libreswan

Example output:

libreswan.x86_64          4.6-3.el9

If the "libreswan" package is not installed, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Install the libreswan service (if it is not already installed) with the following command:

$ sudo dnf install libreswan

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 password-auth must be configured to use a sufficient number of hashing rounds.
Discussion:
Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised. Passwords that are encrypted with a weak algorithm are no more protected than if they are kept in plain text.

Using more hashing rounds makes password cracking attacks more difficult.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000073-GPOS-00041, SRG-OS-000120-GPOS-00061
Check Text:
Verify the number of rounds for the password hashing algorithm is configured with the following command:

$ grep rounds /etc/pam.d/password-auth

password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 rounds=100000

If a matching line is not returned or "rounds" is less than "100000", this a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 to use 100000 hashing rounds for hashing passwords.

Add or modify the following line in "/etc/pam.d/password-auth" and set "rounds" to "100000".

password sufficient pam_unix.so sha512 rounds=100000

Note: Running authselect will overwrite this value unless a custom authselect policy is created.
CCI-004062
For password-based authentication, store passwords using an approved salted key derivation function, preferably using a keyed hash.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must employ FIPS 140-3 approved cryptographic hashing algorithms for all stored passwords.
Discussion:
The system must use a strong hashing algorithm to store the password.

Passwords need to be protected at all times, and encryption is the standard method for protecting passwords. If passwords are not encrypted, they can be plainly read (i.e., clear text) and easily compromised.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000073-GPOS-00041, SRG-OS-000120-GPOS-00061
Check Text:
Verify the interactive user account passwords are using a strong password hash with the following command:

$ sudo cut -d: -f2 /etc/shadow

Password hashes "!" or "*" indicate inactive accounts not available for logon and are not evaluated.

If any interactive user password hash does not begin with "$6$", this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Lock all interactive user accounts not using SHA-512 hashing until the passwords can be regenerated with SHA-512.
