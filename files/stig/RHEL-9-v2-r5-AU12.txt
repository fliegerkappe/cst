Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect /var/log/tallylog.
Discussion:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000392-GPOS-00172, SRG-OS-000470-GPOS-00214, SRG-OS-000473-GPOS-00218
Check Text:
Verify RHEL 9 generates audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/var/log/tallylog" with the following command:

$ sudo auditctl -l | grep /var/log/tallylog

-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

If the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 to generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect "/var/log/tallylog".

Add or update the following file system rule to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

-w /var/log/tallylog -p wa -k logins

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 audit system must protect logon UIDs from unauthorized change.
Discussion:
If modification of login user identifiers (UIDs) is not prevented, they can be changed by nonprivileged users and make auditing complicated or impossible.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000462-GPOS-00206, SRG-OS-000475-GPOS-00220, SRG-OS-000057-GPOS-00027, SRG-OS-000058-GPOS-00028, SRG-OS-000059-GPOS-00029

If the "--loginuid-immutable" option is not returned in the "/etc/audit/audit.rules", or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 auditing to prevent modification of login UIDs once they are set by adding the following line to /etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules:

--loginuid-immutable

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must enable auditing of processes that start prior to the audit daemon.
Discussion:
Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.

If any output is returned, this is a finding.

Check that auditing is enabled by default to persist in kernel updates: 

$ grep audit /etc/default/grub

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="audit=1"

If "audit" is not set to "1", is missing, or is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must enable Linux audit logging for the USBGuard daemon.
Discussion:
Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DOD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 9 will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;

3) All account creations, modifications, disabling, and terminations; and 

4) All kernel module load, unload, and restart actions.
Check Text:
To verify that Linux Audit logging is enabled for the USBGuard daemon with the following command:

$ sudo grep AuditBackend /etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf 

AuditBackend=LinuxAudit 

If "AuditBackend" is not set to "LinuxAudit", this is a finding.

If the system is virtual machine with no virtual or physical USB peripherals attached, this is not a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 USBGuard AuditBackend to use the audit system.

Add or edit the following line in /etc/usbguard/usbguard-daemon.conf 

AuditBackend=LinuxAudit

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 audit package must be installed.
Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Associating event types with detected events in audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured RHEL 9 system.

Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Ensuring the "auditd" service is active ensures audit records generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.

Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 audit system must audit local events.
Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

If option "local_events" isn't set to "yes" only events from network will be aggregated.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000062-GPOS-00031, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227

$ sudo grep local_events /etc/audit/auditd.conf

If "local_events" isn't set to "yes", if the command does not return a line, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must allow only the information system security manager (ISSM) (or individuals or roles appointed by the ISSM) to select which auditable events are to be audited.
Discussion:
Without the capability to restrict the roles and individuals that can select which events are audited, unauthorized personnel may be able to prevent the auditing of critical events. Misconfigured audits may degrade the system's performance by overwhelming the audit log. Misconfigured audits may also make it more difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.
Check Text:
Verify that the files in directory "/etc/audit/rules.d/" and "/etc/audit/auditd.conf" file have a mode of "0640" or less permissive with the following command:

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the chmod, fchmod, and fchmodat system calls.
Discussion:
Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of umount system calls.
Discussion:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Check Text:
Verify that RHEL 9 is configured to audit the execution of the "umount" command with the following command:

$ sudo auditctl -l | grep /usr/bin/umount

-a always,exit -S all -F path=/usr/bin/umount -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=-1 -F key=privileged-mount

If the command does not return an audit rule for "umount" or any of the lines returned are commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the chsh command.
Discussion:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the passwd command.
Discussion:
Without generating audit records specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the sudo command.
Discussion:
Without generating audit record specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must audit all uses of the mount command.
Discussion:
Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1. The auid representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals 4294967295. The audit system interprets -1, 4294967295, and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each system call made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use system call rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. The performance can be helped, however, by combining system calls into one rule whenever possible.

RHEL 9 must generate audit records for all account creations, modifications, disabling, and termination events that affect /etc/shadow.
Discussion:
In addition to auditing new user and group accounts, these watches will alert the system administrator(s) to any modifications. Any unexpected users, groups, or modifications should be investigated for legitimacy.
