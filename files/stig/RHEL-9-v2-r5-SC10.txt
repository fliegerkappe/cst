Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must be configured so that all network connections associated with SSH traffic terminate after becoming unresponsive.
Discussion:
Terminating an unresponsive SSH session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended. In addition, quickly terminating an idle SSH session will also free up resources committed by the managed network element.

Terminating network connections associated with communications sessions includes, for example, deallocating associated TCP/IP address/port pairs at the operating system level and deallocating networking assignments at the application level if multiple application sessions are using a single operating system-level network connection. This does not mean the operating system terminates all sessions or network access; it only ends the unresponsive session and releases the resources associated with that session.

RHEL 9 utilizes /etc/ssh/sshd_config for configurations of OpenSSH. Within the sshd_config, the product of the values of "ClientAliveInterval" and "ClientAliveCountMax" are used to establish the inactivity threshold. The "ClientAliveInterval" is a timeout interval in seconds, after which if no data has been received from the client, sshd will send a message through the encrypted channel to request a response from the client. The "ClientAliveCountMax" is the number of client alive messages that may be sent without sshd receiving any messages back from the client. If this threshold is met, sshd will disconnect the client. For more information on these settings and others, refer to the sshd_config man pages.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000163-GPOS-00072, SRG-OS-000279-GPOS-00109
Check Text:
Verify the "ClientAliveCountMax" is set to "1" by performing the following command:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*clientalivecountmax'

ClientAliveCountMax 1

If "ClientAliveCountMax" does not exist, is not set to a value of "1" in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config", or is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Note: This setting must be applied in conjunction with RHEL-09-255100 to function correctly.

Configure the SSH server to terminate a user session automatically after the SSH client has become unresponsive.

Modify or append the following lines in the "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or in a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d":

ClientAliveCountMax 1

For the changes to take effect, the SSH daemon must be restarted.

$ sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must automatically exit interactive command shell user sessions after 10 minutes of inactivity.
Discussion:
Terminating an idle interactive command shell user session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of it when left unattended in a virtual terminal or physical console.

$ sudo grep -i tmout /etc/profile /etc/profile.d/*.sh

/etc/profile.d/tmout.sh:declare -xr TMOUT=600

If "TMOUT" is not set to "600" or less in a script located in the "/etc/'profile.d/ directory, is missing or is commented out, this is a finding.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must terminate idle user sessions.
Discussion:
Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the window of opportunity for unauthorized personnel to take control of a management session enabled on the console or console port that has been left unattended.
Check Text:
Verify that RHEL 9 logs out sessions that are idle for 15 minutes with the following command:

$ sudo grep -i ^StopIdleSessionSec /etc/systemd/logind.conf

StopIdleSessionSec=900

If "StopIdleSessionSec" is not configured to "900" seconds, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 to log out idle sessions by editing the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file with the following line:

StopIdleSessionSec=900

The "logind" service must be restarted for the changes to take effect. To restart the "logind" service, run the following command:

$ sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
