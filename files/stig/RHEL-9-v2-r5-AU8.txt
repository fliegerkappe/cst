Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must have the chrony package installed.
Discussion:
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.
Check Text:
Verify that RHEL 9 has the chrony package installed with the following command:

$ dnf list --installed chrony

Example output:

chrony.x86_64          4.1-3.el9       

If the "chrony" package is not installed, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
The chrony package can be installed with the following command:
 
$ sudo dnf install chrony

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 chronyd service must be enabled.
Discussion:
Inaccurate time stamps make it more difficult to correlate events and can lead to an inaccurate analysis. Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events. Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.
Check Text:
Verify the chronyd service is active with the following command:

If the chronyd service is not active, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
To enable the chronyd service run the following command:

$ sudo systemctl enable --now chronyd

RHEL 9 must securely compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours.
Discussion:

Sources outside the configured acceptable allowance (drift) may be inaccurate.

Synchronizing internal information system clocks provides uniformity of time stamps for information systems with multiple system clocks and systems connected over a network.

Depending on the infrastructure being used the "pool" directive may not be supported.

Authoritative time sources include the United States Naval Observatory (USNO) time servers, a time server designated for the appropriate DOD network (NIPRNet/SIPRNet), and/or the Global Positioning System (GPS).

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000355-GPOS-00143, SRG-OS-000356-GPOS-00144, SRG-OS-000359-GPOS-00146
Check Text:
Verify RHEL 9 is securely comparing internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with an NTP server with the following commands:

$ sudo grep maxpoll /etc/chrony.conf

server 0.us.pool.ntp.mil iburst maxpoll 16

If the "maxpoll" option is set to a number greater than 16 or the line is commented out, this is a finding.

Verify the "chrony.conf" file is configured to an authoritative DOD time source by running the following command:

$ sudo grep -i server /etc/chrony.conf
server 0.us.pool.ntp.mil 

If the parameter "server" is not set or is not set to an authoritative DOD time source, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure RHEL 9 to securely compare internal information system clocks at least every 24 hours with an NTP server by adding/modifying the following line in the /etc/chrony.conf file.

server [ntp.server.name] iburst maxpoll 16

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 audit package must be installed.
Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Associating event types with detected events in audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured RHEL 9 system.

Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Ensuring the "auditd" service is active ensures audit records generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.

Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions.
