Rule Title:
RHEL 9 system commands must have mode 755 or less permissive.
Discussion:
If RHEL 9 allowed any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement applies to RHEL 9 with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges.
Check Text:
Verify the system commands contained in the following directories have mode "755" or less permissive with the following command:

$ sudo find -L /bin /sbin /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/libexec /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -perm /022 -exec ls -l {} \;

If any system commands are found to be group-writable or world-writable, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure the system commands to be protected from unauthorized access.

Run the following command, replacing "[FILE]" with any system command with a mode more permissive than "755".

$ sudo chmod 755 [FILE]

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must prevent the loading of a new kernel for later execution.
Discussion:
Changes to any software components can have significant effects on the overall security of the operating system. This requirement ensures the software has not been tampered with and that it has been provided by a trusted vendor.

Disabling kexec_load prevents an unsigned kernel image (that could be a windows kernel or modified vulnerable kernel) from being loaded. Kexec can be used subvert the entire secureboot process and should be avoided at all costs especially since it can load unsigned kernel images.

The sysctl --system command will load settings from all system configuration files. All configuration files are sorted by their filename in lexicographic order, regardless of the directories in which they reside. If multiple files specify the same option, the entry in the file with the lexicographically latest name will take precedence. Files are read from directories in the following list from top to bottom. Once a file of a given filename is loaded, any file of the same name in subsequent directories is ignored.

/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf
/run/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/etc/sysctl.conf

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227, SRG-OS-000366-GPOS-00153
Check Text:
Verify RHEL 9 is configured to disable kernel image loading.

Check the status of the kernel.kexec_load_disabled kernel parameter.

$ sudo sysctl kernel.kexec_load_disabled

kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1

If "kernel.kexec_load_disabled" is not set to "1" or is missing, this is a finding.

Check that the configuration files are present to enable this kernel parameter.

$ sudo grep -r kernel.kexec_load_disabled /run/sysctl.d/*.conf /usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /lib/sysctl.d/*.conf /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.d/*.conf

/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf:kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1

If "kernel.kexec_load_disabled" is not set to "1", is missing, or commented out, this is a finding.

If conflicting results are returned, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Add or edit the following line in a system configuration file in the "/etc/sysctl.d/" directory:

kernel.kexec_load_disabled = 1

Remove any configurations that conflict with the above from the following locations: 
/run/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/local/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/usr/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/lib/sysctl.d/*.conf
/etc/sysctl.conf
/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf

Load settings from all system configuration files with the following command:

$ sudo sysctl --system

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must ensure cryptographic verification of vendor software packages.
Discussion:
Cryptographic verification of vendor software packages ensures that all software packages are obtained from a valid source and protects against spoofing that could lead to installation of malware on the system. Red Hat cryptographically signs all software packages, which includes updates, with a GPG key to verify that they are valid.
Check Text:
Confirm Red Hat package-signing keys are installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

Note: For RHEL 9 software packages, Red Hat uses GPG keys labeled "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3". The keys are defined in key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" by default.

List Red Hat GPG keys installed on the system:

$ sudo rpm -q --queryformat "%{SUMMARY}\n" gpg-pubkey | grep -i "red hat"

Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com> public key
Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) <security@redhat.com> public key

If Red Hat GPG keys "release key 2" and "auxiliary key 3" are not installed, this is a finding.

List key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys:

$ sudo gpg -q --keyid-format short --with-fingerprint /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

If key file "/etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release" is missing, this is a finding.

Example output:

pub   rsa4096/FD431D51 2009-10-22 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 567E 347A D004 4ADE 55BA  8A5F 199E 2F91 FD43 1D51
uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (release key 2) <security@redhat.com>
pub   rsa4096/5A6340B3 2022-03-09 [SC]
      Key fingerprint = 7E46 2425 8C40 6535 D56D  6F13 5054 E4A4 5A63 40B3
uid                   Red Hat, Inc. (auxiliary key 3) <security@redhat.com>

Compare key fingerprints of installed Red Hat GPG keys with fingerprints listed for RHEL 9 on Red Hat "Product Signing Keys" webpage at https://access.redhat.com/security/team/key.

If key fingerprints do not match, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Install Red Hat package-signing keys on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

Insert RHEL 9 installation disc or attach RHEL 9 installation image to the system. Mount the disc or image to make the contents accessible inside the system.

Assuming the mounted location is "/media/cdrom", use the following command to copy Red Hat GPG key file onto the system:

$ sudo cp /media/cdrom/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/
	 
Import Red Hat GPG keys from key file into system keyring:

$ sudo rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
	 
Using the steps listed in the Check Text, confirm the newly imported keys show as installed on the system and verify their fingerprints match vendor values.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 library directories must be owned by root.
Discussion:
If RHEL 9 allowed any user to make changes to software libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management process.

This requirement applies to RHEL 9 with software libraries that are accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated privileges.
Check Text:
Verify the systemwide shared library directories are owned by "root" with the following command:

$ sudo find /lib /lib64 /usr/lib /usr/lib64 ! -user root -type d -exec stat -c "%U %n" {} \;

If any systemwide shared library directory is not owned by "root", this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure the systemwide shared library directories within (/lib, /lib64, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64) to be protected from unauthorized access.

Run the following command, replacing "[DIRECTORY]" with any library directory not owned by "root".

$ sudo chown root [DIRECTORY]

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 SSH daemon must not allow GSSAPI authentication.
Discussion:
Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI) authentication is used to provide additional authentication mechanisms to applications. Allowing GSSAPI authentication through SSH exposes the system's GSSAPI to remote hosts, increasing the attack surface of the system.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000364-GPOS-00151, SRG-OS-000480-GPOS-00227
Check Text:
Verify the SSH daemon does not allow GSSAPI authentication with the following command:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -dd 2>&1 | awk '/filename/ {print $4}' | tr -d '\r' | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs sudo grep -iH '^\s*gssapiauthentication'

GSSAPIAuthentication no

If the value is returned as "yes", the returned line is commented out, no output is returned, and the use of GSSAPI authentication has not been documented with the information system security officer (ISSO), this is a finding.

If the required value is not set, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure the SSH daemon to not allow GSSAPI authentication.

Add or uncomment the following line to "/etc/ssh/sshd_config" or to a file in "/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d" and set the value to "no":

GSSAPIAuthentication no

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 SSH daemon must not allow Kerberos authentication.
Discussion:
Kerberos authentication for SSH is often implemented using Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSSAPI). If Kerberos is enabled through SSH, the SSH daemon provides a means of access to the system's Kerberos implementation. Vulnerabilities in the system's Kerberos implementations may be subject to exploitation.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 audit package must be installed.
Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, the source of events, where events occurred, and the outcome of events, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack.

Audit record content that may be necessary to satisfy this requirement includes, for example, time stamps, source and destination addresses, user/process identifiers, event descriptions, success/fail indications, filenames involved, and access control or flow control rules invoked.

Associating event types with detected events in audit logs provides a means of investigating an attack, recognizing resource utilization or capacity thresholds, or identifying an improperly configured RHEL 9 system.

RHEL 9 audit service must be enabled.
Discussion:
Without establishing what type of events occurred, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events leading up to an outage or attack. Ensuring the "auditd" service is active ensures audit records generated by the kernel are appropriately recorded.

Additionally, a properly configured audit subsystem ensures that actions of individual system users can be uniquely traced to those users so they can be held accountable for their actions.
