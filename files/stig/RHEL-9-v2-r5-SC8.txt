Rule Title:
All RHEL 9 networked systems must have and implement SSH to protect the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted and received information, as well as information during preparation for transmission.
Discussion:
Without protection of the transmitted information, confidentiality and integrity may be compromised because unprotected communications can be intercepted and either read or altered. 

This requirement applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, and facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. 

Protecting the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing cryptographic techniques). If physical means of protection are employed, then logical means (cryptography) do not have to be employed, and vice versa.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 wireless network adapters must be disabled.
Discussion:
This requirement applies to wireless peripheral technologies (e.g., wireless mice, keyboards, displays, etc.) used with RHEL 9 systems. Wireless peripherals (e.g., Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/IR keyboards, mice and pointing devices, and near field communications [NFC]) present a unique challenge by creating an open, unsecured port on a computer. Wireless peripherals must meet DOD requirements for wireless data transmission and be approved for use by the Authorizing Official (AO). Even though some wireless peripherals, such as mice and pointing devices, do not ordinarily carry information that need to be protected, modification of communications with these wireless peripherals may be used to compromise the RHEL 9 operating system.

Check Text:
Verify there are no wireless interfaces configured on the system with the following command:

Note: This requirement is Not Applicable for systems that do not have physical wireless network radios.

$ nmcli device status

DEVICE                    TYPE            STATE                    CONNECTION

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must enable FIPS mode.
Discussion:
Use of weak or untested encryption algorithms undermines the purposes of utilizing encryption to protect data. The operating system must implement cryptographic modules adhering to the higher standards approved by the federal government since this provides assurance they have been tested and validated. This includes NIST FIPS-validated cryptography for the following: Provisioning digital signatures, generating cryptographic hashes, and to protect data requiring data-at-rest protections in accordance with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards.

Rule Title:
RHEL 9 must implement DOD-approved encryption in the bind package.
Discussion:
Without cryptographic integrity protections, information can be altered by unauthorized users without detection.

Cryptographic mechanisms used for protecting the integrity of information include, for example, signed hash functions using asymmetric cryptography enabling distribution of the public key to verify the hash information while maintaining the confidentiality of the secret key used to generate the hash.

RHEL 9 incorporates system-wide crypto policies by default. The employed algorithms can be viewed in the /etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/ directory.

Satisfies: SRG-OS-000423-GPOS-00187, SRG-OS-000426-GPOS-00190
Check Text:
Verify that BIND uses the system crypto policy with the following command:

Note: If the "bind" package is not installed, this requirement is Not Applicable.

$ sudo grep include /etc/named.conf 

include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";' 

If BIND is installed and the BIND config file doesn't contain the  include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config" directive, or the line is commented out, this is a finding.
Fix Text:
Configure BIND to use the system crypto policy.

Add the following line to the "options" section in "/etc/named.conf":

include "/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/bind.config";
